# Exam Parking Fee Calculator (examen.cpp)
C++ project developed using Repl.it, an online programming environment.

## Description
I developed this program using the online programming environment Repl.it and saved it with the name `examen.cpp`.

The program calculates the parking fee based on the number of banknotes entered by the user. It generates a random parking fee between 3 and 120 using the `rand()` function after seeding the random number generator with `srand(time(0))`. The user is then prompted to input the number of 1, 5, 10, and 50 banknotes they want to use for payment.

The program calculates the total amount of money entered by the user and compares it to the parking fee. If there's any remaining amount after paying the fee, the program calculates the banknotes to be returned as change. It displays the parking fee, the banknotes entered by the user, and the change, if any.
